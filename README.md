# stanford-tensorflow-tutorials
This repository contains code examples for the course CS 20: TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research. <br>
It will be updated as the class progresses. <br>
Detailed syllabus and lecture notes can be found [here](http://cs20.stanford.edu).<br>
For this course, I use python3.6 and TensorFlow 1.4.1.

For the code and notes of the previous year's course, please see the folder 2017 and the website https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/2017

For setup instruction and the list of dependencies, please see the setup folder of this repository.



#-----------------------------------------------------#
1. The class of CS 20 is helpful to me, as it provides the normative and readable source code about using tensorflow.
2. There are some major change between current contents and initial contents, including two directory "assigment" and "examples". More exactly, I have added more comments for the example codes according to my comprehension.
3. In concolusion, these codes is used to reference and exercise. If you meet some error, please check if environment variables are wrong.
4. As those codes are corresponding to class slices, especially the assigmnet. You would like to visit official website(http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/, equal to the line 7 above.)
